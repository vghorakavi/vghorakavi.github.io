Current website specifications:
Please view website on Safari.
Website has:
* Video looping of lotus.
* Partial resume.
* Links to my online accounts.
* Music.
* Recent photo of me to populate Google's images of me.
* Social media accounts.

To dos:
* Make website multilingual.
* Make a chatbot that keeps people informed of my schedule with capability to update my schedule with new meetings.  It is possible using Jekyll.
* Put a formal version of myself on website.
* Add information about projects, internships, volunteering, blogs, and research.
* Add hobbies. (?)
* Check if website is accessible to everyone. (i.e. visually-impaired)
* Add loading symbol significant to area of work I am doing.
* Possibly make video less distracting by placing it on side.
* Improve overall user interface.  It is cleaner after adding the closing div element, but it is still not clean at all.  I need to see if I can incorporate Jekyll's creative template.

This website was created from scratch(ish) on February 11, 2019.  It took about two hours to create as I was also working on some work with Topcoder.  Timeline will be updated as I work on the website. Total time spent on February 11, 2019: Five hours.  Used APIs and Bootstrap.
